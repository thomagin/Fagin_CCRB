    <div class="section" id="ccrb-info">
        <h2 class="license-plate">What is the CCRB?</h2>
        <p>The Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) is a city agency that reviews complaints about police misconduct and makes recommendations about whether officers should be disciplined if they are found to have acted improperly. 
            The CCRB was created in 1993 in response to decades of allegations of NYPD misconduct. When Mayor Dinkins proposed a civilian agency to handle these allegations, ten thousand police rioted. They blocked traffic on the Brooklyn Bridge, attacked journalists, and chanted racist slogans about Dinkins. The agency survived these challenges.

        <h2 class="license-plate">What is a civilian complaint?</h2>
        <p>A complaint is a formal statement made to an investigator at the CCRB. Any person, regardless of their citizenship status or whether theyâ€™re a resident of New York, can file a complaint. The four primary allegations against NYPD officers are excessive force, abuse of authority, discourtesy, and offensive language. If you believe you have been a victim of police misconduct, you can file a complaint <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/ccrb/complaints/file-complaint.page" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="license-plate">Who is part of the board?</h2>
        <p>The board is designed to consist of 15 members. Five seats are appointed by the Mayor, five by the NYC City Council, three by the Police Commissioner, one by the Public Advocate, and the Chair is jointly appointed by the Mayor and City Council.

            No member of the board is allowed to have a background in law enforcement, other than those designated by the police commissioner, and none may be public employees or serve in public office. They serve three-year terms, which can be and often are renewed. Board members are entitled to receive payment for every session, but some choose to serve free of charge to the city.</p>

        <p>Under the Adams administration, the board has been reduced by over 25% due to vacancies. Over a thousand cases are ruled on by sub-panels of the board every month, and in this diminished state their work becomes more difficult, and less consideration can be given to every case. A rushed process benefits neither the accused officers or the New Yorkers who have filed a complaint.</p>
    </div>
        <p>The previous Chair of the CCRB, Arva Rice, resigned in July 2024 and the position remains unfilled as of December. According to the New York Times, she was pressured to resign by Philip Banks III, the deputy mayor for public safety, after she criticized police officials for delaying an investigation into the fatal shooting of a Bronx man by police. In order to function as intended, the agency needs a chair as well as a full set of board members, and the mayor is currently leaving two of his own appointed seats empty in addition to the chair position.

        <h2 class="license-plate">Substantiation Outcomes by Administration</h2>
        <p>Several types of consequences can result from the CCRB substantiating a complaint. The lightest is Command Discipline A, which typically means the officer who's been found to have acted improperly loses vacation days. The most severe outcome is the filing of charges, which might end with the officer being suspended or dismissed. Let's look at the outcomes of CCRB rulings under the last three mayors.</p>
