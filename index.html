            <h2 class="license-plate">What is the CCRB?</h2>
            <p>The Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) is a city agency that reviews complaints about police misconduct and makes recommendations about whether officers should be disciplined if they are found to have acted improperly. The CCRB was created in 1993 in response to decades of allegations of NYPD misconduct. When Mayor Dinkins proposed a civilian agency to handle these allegations, ten thousand police rioted. They blocked traffic on the Brooklyn Bridge, attacked journalists, and chanted racist slogans about Dinkins. The agency survived these challenges. </p>

                <p>Today, the CCRB has around 150 employees, most of whom are civilian investigators who follow up on allegations against the police. They interview the complainant, the officer(s) in question, and any witnesses. The investigator then transmits their findings to a panel of three board members. The panel decides whether to <strong>substantiate</strong> the findings of completed investigations. If a majority of the panel votes to substantiate the findings, they forward the case to the police commissioner, who is empowered to impose discipline.

    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="license-plate">What is a civilian complaint?</h2>
        <p>A complaint is a formal statement made to an investigator at the CCRB. Any person, regardless of their citizenship status or whether they're a resident of New York, can file a complaint. The four primary allegations against NYPD officers are excessive force, abuse of authority, discourtesy, and offensive language. If you believe you have been a victim of police misconduct, you can file a complaint <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/ccrb/complaints/file-complaint.page" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    
       <!--- <h2 class="license-plate">How does the CCRB work?</h2>
        <p>The CCRB has a staff that receives the complaints, investigates the allegations, interviews the officer(s) in question, and then transmits their findings to a panel of three board members. The panel decides whether to <strong>substantiate</strong> the findings of completed investigations. If a majority of the panel votes to substantiate the findings, they forward the case to the police commissioner, who is empowered to impose discipline.</p> -->
    
        <h2 class="license-plate">Who is part of the board?</h2>
        <p>The board is designed to consist of 15 members. Five seats are appointed by the Mayor, five by the NYC City Council, three by the Police Commissioner, one by the Public Advocate, and the Chair is jointly appointed by the Mayor and City Council. No member of the board is allowed to have a background in law enforcement, other than those designated by the police commissioner, and none may be public employees or serve in public office. They serve three-year terms, which can be renewed. Board members are entitled to receive payment for every session, but some choose to serve free of charge to the city.</p>

        <p>Under the Adams administration, the board has been reduced by over 25% due to vacancies.  Since one mayoral designee, one city council designee, and one police commissioner designee are on the three-member panels that review and vote on cases, the absence of two mayoral appointees has a great effect on how many panels can be formed. Over a thousand cases are ruled on by sub-panels of the board every month, and in this diminished state their work becomes more difficult, and less consideration can be given to every case. A rushed process benefits neither the accused officers or the New Yorkers who have filed a complaint.</p>
    </div>
        <p>The previous chair of the CCRB, Arva Rice, resigned in July 2024 and the position remains unfilled as of December. According to the New York Times, she was pressured to resign by Philip Banks III, the deputy mayor for public safety, after she criticized police officials for delaying an investigation into the fatal shooting of a Bronx man by police. In order to function as intended, the agency needs a chair as well as a full set of board members, and the mayor is currently leaving two of his own appointed seats empty in addition to the chair position.

    <!-- Section 5: Substantiated Rates Pie Charts -->
<div class="section" id="rates-charts">
    <h2 class="license-plate">Substantiation Outcomes by Administration</h2>
    <p>Several types of consequences can result from the CCRB substantiating a complaint. The lightest is Command Discipline A, which typically means the officer who's been found to have acted improperly loses vacation days. The most severe outcome is the filing of charges. The officer is brought before a departmental trial, and if convicted the officer might end up suspended or dismissed. Let's look at the outcomes of CCRB rulings under the last three mayors.</p>
    <div id="legend"></div>
    <!-- The charts will be inserted here by D3 -->
</div>
<div class="section" id="analysis">
    <p>The data is admittedly a little messy: in the Bloomberg era and the beginning of de Blasio's term, there were not separate categories for Command Discipline A and B, so it's difficult to know how severe those outcomes were. Regardless, we can clearly see the shrinking of the proportion of complaints that end with charges. Although the CCRB might substantiate a greater proportion of complaints under Eric Adams, the outcomes are generally less severe for the officers when they are found to have abused their authority.</p>

    <!-- Section 8: small multiple complaint types -->
    <div class="section" id="complaints-section">
        <h2 class="license-plate">Complaints and Substantiation by Type</h2>
        <p>Not every civilian complaint concerns the use of physical violence. The CCRB has four main categories for the complaints they receive: Force, Abuse of Authority, Discourtesy, and Offensive Language (FADO). How does the CCRB handle these different types of complaints?</p>
        <div id="complaints-small-multiples">
            <div id="complaints-small-multiples-vis"></div>
            <div id="complaints-small-multiples-tooltip"></div>

                <p> <p>Each row shows a type of complaint. Square size shows total number of complaints, 
                    while color intensity indicates substantiation rate.</p></p>
            </div>
            <p>No matter who the mayor is, the most common complaints concern abuse of authority; such complaints are also among the most likely to be substantiated. An example of abuse of authority includes Fourth Amendment violations such as illegal searches, or unlawful frisks and detentions. Another example unrelated to the Fourth Amendment would be an officer's refusal to provide a name and shield number. </p>
                <p>Across the board, the least likely type of complaint to be substantiated concerns the use of force. Offensive language and discourtesy were three or four times more likely to be substantiated by Eric Adams' CCRB. 
                Considering these are violations that do not typically infringe on citizens' rights or inflict phyiscal harm, it follows that the punishments administered to officers have been declining in severity.</p>

        <p>Let's take a look at whether race and sex play any part in how the CCRB makes decisions, and if any differences emerge when comparing the last three mayors' terms.</p>
        <div id="demographics-heatmap"></div>
        <p>During Bloomberg and de Blasio's tenures, Black men were the most likely demographic to have their complaint substantiated by the CCRB. They were also the most likely to file a complaint. Asian men and women have a markedly higher rate of substantiation during the Adams era, though they file significantly fewer complaints.</p>
        <p>Looking at this data, the constant over all three mayoralties is the lower rate of substantiation of women's complaints about police misconduct.</p>
    </div>


   <!-- Section 10: Additional Information -->
   <div class="section" id="additional-info">
    <h2 class="license-plate">Why should you care about the CCRB?</h2>
    <p>The CCRB has its share of critics. The agency has long been regarded with suspicion and contempt by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/16/nyregion/nypd-discipline-recommendations.html" target="_blank">police</a>, but it also has critics on the <a href="https://indypendent.org/2023/01/time-to-scrap-the-useless-civilian-complaint-review-board/" target="_blank">left</a>, who argue that the CCRB exists to give the illusion of oversight without the ability to impose real disciplinary consequences.</p>
    
    <p>No matter what position you take, the agency exists and will continue functioning until it is formally abolished. As New Yorkers, we live with the NYPD and we should have some say in how its officers uphold the law. Our votes for mayor will indirectly shape the composition of the board. If you want a more lenient board, you should vote for a candidate who is skeptical of police oversight; if you want a more punitive board, you should vote for a candidate who is in favor of reining in the NYPD.</p>

    <h2 class="license-plate">When can you vote for the CCRB you want to see?</h2>
    <p>The election for mayor of New York City will be held on November 4, 2025. However, the primary elections will be held in June, and if recent years are any indication this is likely when New Yorkers will be choosing their next mayor.</p>

    <h2 class="license-plate">What can you do in the meantime?</h2>
    <p>If you want to learn more about the activities of the CCRB, the board holds public meetings where they update the public, take questions, and hear concerns related to police misconduct. The meetings are open to the public and anyone can ask a question. These meetings typically take place on the second Wednesday of each month at 4:00 PM, and every year they hold at least one meeting in each borough. If you want to speak directly to the people invested with the power to make decisions about police misconduct, you should go and speak your mind.</p>
    
    <h2 class="license-plate">Other ways to shape police oversight</h2>
    <p>Elections aren't the only way to make the CCRB change course. On July 17, 2014, Eric Garner was killed by a police officer who used a chokehold to subdue him for allegedly selling loose cigarettes, a misdemeanor. 
        After widespread protests and pressure, the NYPD adopted several reforms, including the use of body worn cameras, and the officer who killed Garner was eventually fired. However, we can also see a shift in the CCRB's handling of similar cases:
    </p>
</div>

 <!-- Section 9: chokehold comparison-->
<div class="section" id="chokehold-rate">
    <h2 class="license-plate">Chokeholds after Eric Garner</h2>
    <div id="visualization"></div>

    <p>The CCRB is roughly <strong>five times</strong> more likely to substantiate a case involving a chokehold now than they were before the killing of Eric Garner. This is the result of public pressure and the increased scrutiny of police misconduct brought about by New Yorkers across the city who joined together to demand change. So there's no need to wait until an election, or even for the next public meeting of the CCRB. New Yorkers can influence the way this agency does its work by simply joining together and demanding better police oversight.</p>
</div>
    </html>

    <div class="section" id="about-this-data">
        <h2 class="license-plate">About this data</h2>
        <p>All of the above has been drawn from data made available to the public by the CCRB's Data Transparency Initiative. They conduct <a href=https://www.nyc.gov/site/ccrb/policy/data-transparency-initiative.page target="_blank">their own analyses</a> of the same data, and you should feel free to look for yourself. Besides the important work the CCRB does in handling and investigating these complaints, their compiling and releasing this information sheds light on something that was invisible before. Without this resource, we would only encounter Fourth Amendment violations in the context of a court case: a police officer conducted a search unlawfully and they find a gun or something illegal, and it might get suppressed or dismissed because they didn't follow the law. But only seeing this outcome, when the case has reached the courts, fosters a distorted cost/benefit analysis of these police practices. You might be tempted to think, "Well, the search was illegal but they did get a gun off the streets." However, as the data shows, in reality these searches happen far more often than the system or the public can ever understand, but they're just never reported unless someone files a complaint to the CCRB which results in a substantiated abuse of authority allegation. So we owe a debt of gratitude to the CCRB for not only their everyday work, but the recording and publication of their efforts.
